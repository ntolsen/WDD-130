            <p>Since the reed is the part of the saxophone that makes the actual sound, it is important to make the right choice. Below is a list of various brands/types of reeds.</p>

                <h1>Vandoren</h1>
                <p>
                Out of all of the brands, Vandoren is definitely one of the most popular. Beginners and Experts alike often choose Vandoren reeds as they are high quality at a reasonable price. Another good thing about them is consistency. Not every reed in a box is going to be a good reed, but Vandoren definitely seems to be the most consistent in having at least most of the box be good reeds. Also, if you want a reed more curated for a different style of music, they also offer other kinds of reed, like the Vandoren Java Green, for example, that is specifcally made for jazz.

            <h1>Legere</h1>
            <p>
                Legere is a special brand of saxophone reed, as they specialize in producing plastic/synthetic reeds. There are many players that prefer cane reeds over synthetic reeds, as for some the sound, response, or playability could be very different and not what they're used to, but they're still worth the shot. Synthetic reeds are also much more expensive than cane reeds, with one synthetic reed being about the same price as a whole box of cane reeds, but the pros outweigh the cons. Synthetic reeds are much more durable and long-lasting than cane reeds. They take significantly longer to wear out and since they aren't made from natural materials, they don't grow mold if left in the wrong environment. Also, every saxophone player knows the struggle of opening a new box of reeds and having to test out their reeds to see if they're good or not, since reeds made from natural sources are hard to make consistently high quality. If quality consistency is a problem you face, then give plastic reeds a shot.

            <h1>Rico</h1>
            <p>It is very common within the saxophone community to say that Rico reeds are bad, but in reality, this is not the case. Rico is definitely a budget brand, being cheaper than most others, but quality doesn't suffer greatly as a result. The only thing that Rico reeds really suffer with is consistency of quality. Most of the time, Rico reeds are going to have the least amount of good reeds in a box. If you're on a budget, however, Rico is still a good option</p>
