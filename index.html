    <h2>As for a nick name, I also go by Nick, but either is fine</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Nicholas, and I'm a Software Engineering major.</p>
    <p>I'm originally from Kansas, where I lived for about 14 years.</p>
    <p>For hobbies, I really enjoy video games, saxophone, and studying French</p>
    <p>I served a mission in the Republic of Congo, Brazzaville mission, which is how I first started learning French, since that's what they speak there.</p>
    <p>The thing that I like the most about BYU-I is how much we connect spiritual things with what we're learning. We know that we learn the truth of all things through the Spirit, so if we invite him into our studies, we will succeed.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church my whole life.</p>
